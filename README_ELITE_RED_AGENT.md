# HYDRA Elite Red Agent

This package provides an elite-level Red Agent for HYDRA, designed to simulate sophisticated threat actors with advanced attack techniques and real-world tactics. The Elite Red Agent is trained using advanced machine learning techniques and real-world threat intelligence to provide the most realistic security validation possible.

## Overview

The Elite Red Agent introduces several significant enhancements:

1. **Advanced Threat Actor Simulation**: Implements attack strategies based on sophisticated threat actors like APT29, APT41, Lazarus Group, and FIN7.

2. **MITRE ATT&CK Framework Integration**: Fully aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework for comprehensive coverage of real-world tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

3. **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Uses sophisticated neural networks to learn and adapt attack strategies based on success rates, detection rates, and environmental factors.

4. **Campaign-Based Attacks**: Simulates realistic attack campaigns with specific goals and sophisticated attack chains.

5. **Advanced Threat Intelligence**: Incorporates detailed threat intelligence from real-world attacks to inform decision-making.

6. **Progressive Training Methodology**: Trained using a multi-phase approach that gradually increases difficulty and introduces adversarial scenarios.

## Components

This package includes:

- **Enhanced Red Agent Implementation** (`agents/enhanced_red_agent.py`): The core agent implementation with advanced attack strategies and learning capabilities.

- **Advanced Threat Intelligence Data** (`data/advanced_threat_intelligence.json`): Comprehensive threat intelligence data used to train and inform the agent.

- **Elite Training Script** (`train_elite_red_agent.py`): Advanced training script with progressive difficulty, adversarial training, and specialized technique training.

- **Elite Simulation Script** (`run_elite_simulation.py`): Script to run extended simulations with the Elite Red Agent, including attack chain tracking and comprehensive reporting.

## Training the Elite Red Agent

The Elite Red Agent uses a sophisticated three-phase training approach:

### Phase 1: Progressive Difficulty Training

```bash
./train_elite_red_agent.py --num-episodes 20 --steps-per-episode 50
```

This phase gradually increases the difficulty of the training environments, forcing the agent to develop more sophisticated attack strategies.

### Phase 2: Adversarial Training

The agent is trained against environments with enhanced defenses, simulating well-protected networks with advanced security controls.

### Phase 3: Specialized Technique Training

The agent is trained on specific advanced techniques like zero-day exploitation, supply chain compromise, and firmware implants.

### Training Options

- `--num-episodes`: Number of training episodes per difficulty level
- `--steps-per-episode`: Base number of steps per episode
- `--red-skill`: Initial red agent skill level (0.0-1.0)
- `--learning-rate`: Learning rate for neural network
- `--threat-intel`: Path to advanced threat intelligence data file

## Running Elite Simulations

To run an extended simulation with the Elite Red Agent:

```bash
./run_elite_simulation.py --network-size medium --num-steps 200 --model models/elite_red_agent_final_TIMESTAMP.pt
```

### Simulation Options

- `--network-size`: Size of the network (small, medium, large)

## Advanced Attack Strategies

The Elite Red Agent includes several sophisticated attack strategies based on real-world threat actors:

### APT29 (Cozy Bear)

- **Techniques**: Spear phishing with zero-day exploits, custom malware implants, living off the land, supply chain compromise
- **Target Preference**: High-value targets with low security visibility

### APT41 (Double Dragon)

- **Description**: Elite dual espionage and financially-motivated threat actor with exceptional technical capabilities
- **Tactics**: Initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, exfiltration, impact
- **Techniques**: Supply chain compromise, zero-day exploitation, firmware implants, web shell, backdoor implantation
- **Target Preference**: Databases, servers, and cloud instances

### Lazarus Group

- **Description**: Highly skilled state-sponsored threat actor known for destructive attacks and financial theft
- **Tactics**: Initial access, execution, privilege escalation, discovery, lateral movement, collection, exfiltration, impact
- **Techniques**: Watering hole attacks, destructive malware, custom backdoors, wiping malware, cryptocurrency theft
- **Target Preference**: Financial systems, cryptocurrency exchanges, critical infrastructure

### FIN7

- **Description**: Elite financially-motivated threat actor targeting payment card data and financial systems
- **Tactics**: Initial access, execution, persistence, lateral movement, collection, exfiltration
- **Techniques**: Targeted spear phishing, social engineering, point of sale malware, custom backdoors
- **Target Preference**: Retail, hospitality, restaurant, and financial services

## Campaign Goals

The Elite Red Agent can pursue different campaign goals with sophisticated attack chains:

1. **Data Theft**: Focus on stealing sensitive data from high-value targets
2. **Persistence**: Establish long-term access across diverse systems
3. **Disruption**: Disrupt operations by compromising critical systems
4. **Ransomware**: Deploy ransomware across the network for maximum impact

## Attack Chain Analysis

The Elite Red Agent tracks and analyzes attack chains, providing valuable insights into how sophisticated attackers move through your network:

- **Initial Access**: How attackers first gain access to your network
- **Lateral Movement**: How attackers move between systems
- **Privilege Escalation**: How attackers gain higher privileges
- **Data Collection**: How attackers identify and collect valuable data
- **Impact**: The ultimate effect of the attack campaign

## Customizing Threat Intelligence

You can customize the advanced threat intelligence data to focus on specific threats relevant to your environment:

1. Edit the `data/advanced_threat_intelligence.json` file
2. Add or modify threat actors, techniques, and vulnerabilities
3. Adjust success rates and detection rates based on your environment
4. Re-train the agent with your customized threat intelligence

## Viewing Results

After running an elite simulation:

1. Check the `results` directory for detailed JSON results
2. View HTML reports in the `reports` directory
3. Explore network snapshots in the `network_snapshots` directory
4. Analyze attack chains in the `attack_chains` directory
5. Use the dashboard to visualize attack paths and compromised nodes

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Shorter Simulations**: Begin with shorter simulations to understand the agent's capabilities
2. **Gradually Increase Complexity**: Start with simple scenarios and gradually increase complexity
3. **Focus on Attack Chains**: Pay special attention to the attack chains to understand how sophisticated attackers operate
4. **Analyze High-Value Targets**: Focus on how the agent targets and compromises high-value systems
5. **Compare with Blue Agent**: Analyze the interaction between the Red and Blue agents to identify security gaps

## Troubleshooting

- **Agent Too Aggressive**: Reduce the red skill level or modify the threat intelligence data
- **Agent Too Stealthy**: Increase the detection rates in the threat intelligence data
- **Performance Issues**: Reduce network size or complexity for faster simulations
- **Memory Issues**: Reduce the number of steps or the size of the network
