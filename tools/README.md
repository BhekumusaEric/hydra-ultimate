# HYDRA ROI Calculator

## Overview

The HYDRA ROI Calculator is a tool designed to help organizations estimate the potential return on investment from implementing HYDRA for security validation and improvement. The calculator uses industry benchmarks and customizable parameters to provide a comprehensive ROI analysis over a three-year period.

## Features

- **Customizable Organization Profile**: Tailor the analysis to your organization's size, industry, and security maturity
- **Comprehensive Benefit Analysis**: Calculate benefits across multiple categories including risk reduction, tool optimization, and efficiency improvements
- **Visual ROI Reporting**: View ROI metrics, charts, and detailed breakdowns
- **Detailed Timeline**: See how costs and benefits evolve over a three-year period
- **Payback Period Calculation**: Determine when your investment in HYDRA will break even

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly

### Setup

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x roi_calculator.py
```

## Usage

Run the calculator with Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run roi_calculator.py
```

This will launch the ROI calculator in your default web browser.

## Customization

The calculator includes default values based on industry benchmarks, but you can customize all parameters to match your specific environment:

### Organization Profile

- **Organization Size**: Select your organization's size category
- **Industry**: Choose your industry for relevant breach cost benchmarks
- **Infrastructure Complexity**: Indicate the complexity of your IT environment
- **Security Maturity**: Select your current security program maturity level
- **Annual Security Budget**: Enter your organization's security spending

### Risk Profile

- **Average Cost of Data Breach**: Customize the potential impact of a breach
- **Annual Breach Probability**: Adjust the likelihood of experiencing a breach

### HYDRA Implementation

- **Implementation Model**: Select the appropriate HYDRA deployment model
- **Implementation Cost**: Customize the one-time implementation cost
- **Annual Subscription**: Adjust the ongoing subscription cost

### Expected Benefits

- **Breach Risk Reduction**: Estimate the reduction in breach probability
- **Security Tool Optimization**: Estimate savings from optimized security tools
- **Penetration Testing Reduction**: Estimate reduction in external testing costs
- **Security Team Efficiency**: Estimate productivity improvements

## Methodology

The ROI calculator uses the following methodology:

1. **Costs**:
   - One-time implementation costs
   - Ongoing subscription costs

2. **Benefits**:
   - Risk reduction (reduced expected breach costs)
   - Security tool optimization savings
   - Penetration testing cost reduction
   - Security team efficiency improvements

3. **ROI Calculation**:
   - Total ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs
   - Payback Period = Time until Cumulative Net Benefits > 0
   - Net Benefit = Total Benefits - Total Costs

4. **Benefit Realization Timeline**:
   - Risk reduction benefits ramp up over the first year
   - Tool optimization and pentest reduction benefits realize within the first year
   - Efficiency benefits gradually increase over two years

## Customizing the Calculator

To modify the calculator for specific use cases:

1. **Update Industry Benchmarks**: Modify the data breach cost and probability maps in the code
2. **Adjust Benefit Calculations**: Modify the benefit calculation formulas
3. **Change Visualization**: Customize the charts and metrics displayed
