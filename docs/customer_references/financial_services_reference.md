# Customer Reference: Global Financial Corporation

## Customer Profile

- **Industry**: Financial Services (Banking and Investment Management)
- **Size**: Fortune 500, 75,000+ employees, $40B+ annual revenue
- **Location**: Headquarters in New York, operations in 30+ countries
- **Environment**: Hybrid cloud infrastructure, 50,000+ endpoints, 10,000+ servers

## Challenge

Global Financial Corporation (GFC) faced significant challenges in validating the effectiveness of their security controls across their complex environment:

- **Regulatory Pressure**: Increasing scrutiny from regulators regarding cybersecurity resilience, including SEC, OCC, and international financial regulators
- **Advanced Threats**: Targeted by sophisticated threat actors seeking financial data and access to funds transfer systems
- **Tool Overload**: Multiple security tools generating thousands of alerts daily with high false positive rates
- **Validation Gap**: Inability to validate the effectiveness of existing security controls between annual penetration tests
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited red team resources to conduct regular security testing across their global infrastructure

"We were spending millions on security tools but had limited visibility into how these tools would perform against sophisticated attacks. Our annual penetration tests only provided point-in-time validation, and we needed continuous assurance that our controls were effective," said James Wilson, Chief Information Security Officer at GFC.

## Solution

GFC implemented HYDRA to provide continuous validation of their security controls:

- **Enterprise Deployment**: Deployed HYDRA across their global infrastructure with a focus on critical financial systems
- **Digital Twin Creation**: Created digital twins of their core banking systems, trading platforms, and customer-facing applications
- **Integration**: Integrated HYDRA with their Splunk SIEM, ServiceNow ticketing system, and vulnerability management platform
- **Custom Scenarios**: Developed financial services-specific attack scenarios targeting their unique environment
- **Continuous Validation**: Implemented automated weekly simulations with daily targeted testing of critical systems

"The implementation process was straightforward, and the HYDRA team worked closely with us to ensure the platform was properly configured for our environment. Within weeks, we were running sophisticated attack simulations that mimicked the threats we face daily," said Sarah Chen, Security Architecture Director at GFC.

## Results

After implementing HYDRA, GFC achieved significant improvements in their security posture:

- **78% reduction** in exploitable attack paths to critical financial systems
- **63% reduction** in mean time to detect (MTTD) security incidents
- **45% reduction** in false positives from security tools
- **92% increase** in detection coverage for sophisticated attacks
- **$1.2M annual savings** from optimized security tool investments
- **40% reduction** in external penetration testing costs

"HYDRA has transformed our approach to security validation. For the first time, we can continuously test our defenses against sophisticated attacks and quantify our security posture. The platform identified critical vulnerabilities that our existing tools missed, helping us prioritize our security investments and demonstrate compliance to regulators," said James Wilson, CISO.

## Business Impact

Beyond the technical security improvements, GFC realized significant business benefits:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Successfully demonstrated continuous security validation to regulators, resulting in positive examination outcomes
- **Board Confidence**: Provided quantifiable security metrics to the board, increasing confidence in security investments
- **Operational Efficiency**: Security team productivity improved by 30% through better prioritization and reduced alert fatigue
- **Risk Reduction**: Estimated prevention of at least one major security incident, with potential savings of $15-20M in breach costs
- **Competitive Advantage**: Enhanced security posture used as a differentiator with institutional clients concerned about data protection

"Our board and executive leadership now have unprecedented visibility into our security posture. We can show them exactly how effective our security investments are and where we need to focus our resources. This has completely changed the conversation from security as a cost center to security as a business enabler," said Maria Rodriguez, Chief Risk Officer at GFC.
