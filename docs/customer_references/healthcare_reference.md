# Customer Reference: Metropolitan Healthcare Network

## Customer Profile

- **Industry**: Healthcare (Integrated Delivery Network)
- **Size**: Regional healthcare system with 12 hospitals, 60+ clinics, 25,000+ employees
- **Location**: Headquarters in Chicago, facilities across the Midwest
- **Environment**: Hybrid infrastructure, 30,000+ endpoints, 3,000+ servers, 5,000+ medical devices

## Challenge

Metropolitan Healthcare Network (MHN) faced significant cybersecurity challenges while balancing patient care priorities:

- **Ransomware Threat**: Increasing ransomware attacks targeting healthcare organizations threatened patient care continuity
- **Medical Device Security**: Thousands of connected medical devices with varying security capabilities and limited patching options
- **PHI Protection**: Responsibility for protecting sensitive patient health information under HIPAA and state regulations
- **Limited Resources**: Small security team managing a large, complex attack surface with clinical and administrative systems
- **Legacy Systems**: Critical clinical applications running on legacy platforms with inherent security limitations

"Healthcare organizations face a unique challenge: we must secure highly sensitive patient data and critical care systems while ensuring that security measures don't impede clinical workflows or patient care," said Dr. Robert Johnson, CISO at MHN. "Traditional security testing approaches were too disruptive to use in our clinical environments, leaving us with significant blind spots in our security posture."

## Solution

MHN implemented HYDRA to provide continuous security validation without disrupting clinical operations:

- **Healthcare-Specific Deployment**: Deployed HYDRA with special consideration for clinical systems and medical devices
- **Digital Twin Creation**: Created digital twins of their EHR system, clinical networks, and connected medical devices
- **Safe Testing**: Implemented non-disruptive testing methodologies for clinical and medical device environments
- **Integration**: Integrated HYDRA with their ELK SIEM, ServiceNow ticketing system, and medical device inventory
- **Compliance Mapping**: Mapped security validation to HIPAA Security Rule and HITRUST CSF requirements

"HYDRA's approach allowed us to safely validate our security controls without risking disruption to patient care. The platform's ability to create accurate digital twins of our clinical environment was a game-changer for us," said Sarah Williams, Security Operations Director at MHN.

## Results

After implementing HYDRA, MHN achieved significant improvements in their security posture:

- **85% reduction** in potential PHI data exfiltration paths
- **67% improvement** in detection of lateral movement within clinical networks
- **73% reduction** in medical device security vulnerabilities
- **50% reduction** in security alert noise
- **40% improvement** in HIPAA compliance posture
- **$2.1M savings** in avoided penetration testing and security consulting costs

"HYDRA has given us unprecedented visibility into our security posture across both clinical and administrative systems. We've identified and remediated critical vulnerabilities that could have led to a devastating ransomware attack or patient data breach," said Dr. Johnson. "Most importantly, we've achieved this without disrupting clinical operations or patient care."

## Business Impact

Beyond the technical security improvements, MHN realized significant business benefits:

- **Patient Safety**: Enhanced protection of critical clinical systems that directly impact patient care
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Streamlined HIPAA compliance with comprehensive evidence of security control effectiveness
- **Operational Efficiency**: Security team now focuses on high-value activities rather than manual testing and false positives
- **Cyber Insurance**: Reduced premiums by 15% by demonstrating comprehensive security validation
- **Merger Integration**: Accelerated security assessment and integration of newly acquired facilities

"The impact of HYDRA extends far beyond technical security metrics. By preventing potential security incidents, we're protecting our ability to deliver patient care without disruption. That's our ultimate mission," said Jennifer Martinez, Chief Operating Officer at MHN.
